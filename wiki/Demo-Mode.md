# Demo Mode

Demo mode lets you run a public "try before you install" instance of TREK. A shared demo account is available for visitors, who can view, edit and create trips. Account-level and upload operations are blocked for that account, and the database resets automatically every hour so the instance stays in a known state.

## Enabling demo mode

Set `DEMO_MODE=true` in your environment and restart TREK. See [Environment-Variables](Environment-Variables) for how to set environment variables.

When demo mode is active, the login page shows a one-click **Try the demo** button ("no registration needed"). Clicking it logs the visitor in as the demo user immediately. No credentials need to be entered and no registration is required.

**Demo account (auto-created on first start):**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `demo@trek.app` |
| Password | `demo12345` |

**Admin account:** an admin account is also seeded on first start. By default it uses username `admin`, email `admin@trek.app`, and password `admin12345`. You can override these at seed time with the `DEMO_ADMIN_USER`, `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `DEMO_ADMIN_PASS` environment variables (they only take effect when `DEMO_MODE=true`, on the first start before the database is seeded). See [Environment-Variables](Environment-Variables).

## The welcome popup

Every time the dashboard opens for a demo visitor, a **Welcome to the TREK Demo** popup appears over it. It is shown in the visitor's language when TREK has a translation for it. It holds:

- A short description: visitors can view, edit and create trips, and all changes are reset every hour.
- A live countdown, **Next reset in N minutes**, counted to the top of the next hour.
- A note that file uploads (photos, documents, covers) are disabled in demo mode.
- **What is TREK?**, a one line description of the product.
- **Modular Addons**, six tiles for Vacay, Atlas, Packing, Budget, Documents and Widgets with a line each. These are the addons a self-hosted admin can switch off.
- **Additionally in the full version**: file uploads, API key management, user and permission management, automatic backups, addon management and OIDC / SSO.
- An open source note with a **self-host it** link.

**Got it** closes the popup. It appears again the next time the dashboard loads.

## What the demo user can and cannot do

The demo user can work with the shared example trips like any member, but the following operations are permanently blocked:

- **Password change**: returns 403.
- **Account deletion**: returns 403.
- **MFA enrollment or removal**: returns 403. The 2FA card in Settings says it is not available in demo mode, and the Passkeys card is hidden.
- **File uploads**: avatars, trip and collection covers, place images, trip files, journey photos, videos and covers, and the files and images attached to collab notes and chat messages are blocked and return 403. A chat message without an image still posts. [Document-Sync](Document-Sync) is not covered by this block: all its stores ship switched off, but once an administrator switches one on, the demo account can bind a trip it owns in the trip's file manager and pull documents from that store into the trip files, also through the `sync_trip_documents` MCP tool.
- **All MCP write tools**: create, update, and delete operations via the MCP API are blocked for the demo user.

Registration is also disabled while demo mode is active; visitors cannot create new accounts.

The admin account is unaffected and retains full access.

## Hourly reset

TREK schedules an automatic hourly reset of the demo database. At each reset:

1. The current `travel.db` is replaced with the saved baseline (`travel-baseline.db`).
2. The admin account's credentials (`password_hash`, API keys, avatar) are re-applied on top of the restored baseline, so admin API keys and password changes survive the reset, but only when `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL` is set explicitly.

If no baseline has been saved yet, the reset is skipped and a message is logged.

The seeder defaults the admin address to `admin@trek.app` while the reset defaults it to `admin@nomad.app`, a legacy quirk that is pinned deliberately. With `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL` unset the reset looks up an address that does not exist, finds no admin row, and skips the carry-over entirely; a password change, API key or avatar set after the baseline was saved is lost on every hourly reset. Set `DEMO_ADMIN_EMAIL` (to `admin@trek.app`, for instance) if you want them to survive. Unlike the seed-time variables above, the reset reads it on every run, so setting it on an already-seeded instance and restarting is enough.

The instance-wide Maps and Unsplash keys stored in `app_settings` are carried across either way, so map and photo search keep working after a reset.

Everybody signed in stays signed in. The baseline holds no sign-in sessions of its own, so the sessions that are active when the reset runs are carried across as well, for every account the baseline still holds under the same email. A visitor or admin mid-session is not sent back to the login screen on the hour.

## Saving a baseline

The baseline is the snapshot the hourly reset restores to. The admin can update it at any time:

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/save-demo-baseline`

In the admin panel, a **Demo Baseline** card sits above the tabs while demo mode is on; its **Save Baseline** button calls this endpoint. The baseline captures the current state of the database, trip data, settings and encrypted API keys included, so demo features (maps, photos, weather) continue to work after each reset. It is written as a consistent snapshot and only then put in place of the previous baseline, so a save that fails leaves the previous one intact.

On first start with demo mode active, TREK seeds three example trips (Tokyo & Kyoto, Barcelona Long Weekend, New York City) owned by the admin and shared with the demo user, then saves the initial baseline automatically once the server is up. The same happens when a backup restored onto a demo instance without a baseline holds no admin trips: the example trips are seeded into the restored database and it becomes the baseline. Only a seeding start or restore saves a baseline on its own: an instance that already holds data but has no baseline keeps skipping the hourly reset until the admin saves one.

## Limitations

- Demo mode is not for production use with real user data. The hourly reset deletes all visitor-created content.
- All demo visitors share a single account; there is no isolation between sessions.
- Because the demo account is shared, its session list (`GET /api/auth/sessions`) shows each visitor only their own session, and ending sessions (`DELETE /api/auth/sessions/{id}`, `POST /api/auth/sessions/revoke-others`) answers 403 `Sessions cannot be ended in demo mode.`, so one visitor cannot see or sign out the others. Logging out still ends the visitor's own session.
- File uploads (photos, documents, trip covers, avatars) are disabled for the demo user.
